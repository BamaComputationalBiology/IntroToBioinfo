You can complete this tutorial on your computer or on ASC. If you complete it on your computer you will need to download the data files from ASC. If you complete it on ASC you will need to download the graphs to your computer at the end.

Doing three-way comparisons is beyond the scope of this class so you will need to do 2 2-way comparisons (Wild-type vs. paraquat, wild-type vs. paraquat+LNAME). This tutorial will run you through 1 2-way comparison and you will need to do the other 1 on your own. 

To download the data files:
***Log on to ASC
***Copy the data files (all end with .txt) from the shared directory into your home directory on ASC
***exit ASC***

From your local computer, open the terminal and secure copy:

    $ scp ualcls***@dmc.asc.edu:~/*.txt ./

To analyze data on ASC:

    $   module load R
    
    $   R

Once your R instance has started load the DESeq2 package

    > library(DESeq2)

If you get an error (i.e., on your local computer) you probably need to install the packages following:

install.packages(“DESeq2”)

In R construct a DESeqDataSet object

    > directory<-"."

    > sampleFiles <- grep("treated",list.files(directory),value=TRUE)

Hint for when you go on to do these yourself: ‘grep’ is functioning like it does in the bash shell and looking for the word ‘treated’ in file names. 

    > sampleCondition<-c("treated","treated","treated","untreated","untreated","untreated")

    > sampleTable<-data.frame(sampleName=sampleFiles, fileName=sampleFiles, condition=sampleCondition)
 
    > ddsHTSeq<-DESeqDataSetFromHTSeqCount(sampleTable=sampleTable, directory=directory, design=~condition)

    > colData(ddsHTSeq)$condition<-factor(colData(ddsHTSeq)$condition, levels=c("untreated","treated"))

Remove zeros

    > ddsHTSeq <- ddsHTSeq[ rowSums(counts(ddsHTSeq)) > 1, ]

Perform DESeq estimation

    > dds<-DESeq(ddsHTSeq)

Place results in an R object

    > res<-results(dds)

    > res<-res[order(res$padj),]

    > head(res)

Look at your results

    > res

Check for outliers

    > png(file="DESeq2_boxplot.png")

    > boxplot(log10(assays(dds)[["cooks"]]), range=0, las=2)

    > dev.off()

Creating a png object before you call 'boxplot' will print your plot to your object. The dev.off() line tells R that you are done printing to this object and are turning this print device off. If you prefer to view your graphs interactively use the boxplot call without the previous 'png' line and without the 'dev.off' line, like this:

    > boxplot(log10(assays(dds)[["cooks"]]), range=0, las=2)

Your boxplot should pop up on your screen if you are working in R on your local computer. If you are on ASC you can't window your graphs and you will need to print them to files to download and view. 

Order your results by p-value

    > resOrdered <- res[order(res$padj),]

    > summary(resOrdered)

    > head(resOrdered)

Examine how your alpha value (FDR) affects the number of significantly differentially expressed genes (Look at the number of rows in the DataFrame)

    > sum(res$padj < 0.1, na.rm=TRUE)

    > res05 <- results(dds,alpha=0.05)

    > summary(res05)

    > res01 <- results(dds,alpha=0.01)

    > summary(res01)

Get more information about your columns

    > mcols(res)$description

Plot expression by fold up- and down- regulation

    > png(file="DESeq2_lfc.png")

    > plotMA(res,main="DESeq2",ylim=c(-2,2))

    > dev.off()

The red genes are significantly differentially expressed. Now, look at expression for a single gene (here, the one with the smallest p-value)

    > png(file="DESeq2_smallest.png")

    > plotCounts(dds,gene=which.min(res$padj), intgroup="condition")

    > dev.off()

Make it a ggplot

    > library(ggplot2)

    > library(RColorBrewer)

    > d <- plotCounts(dds, gene=which.min(res$padj),intgroup="condition",returnData=TRUE)

    > png(file="ggplot.png")

    > ggplot(d,aes(x=condition,y=count)) + geom_point(position=position_jitter(w=0.1,h=0)) + scale_y_log10(breaks=c(25,100,400))

    > dev.off()

Look at the significant genes

    > resSig <- subset(resOrdered,padj<0.1)

Write your results to a comma-separated file (this file can be opened in Excel)

    > write.csv(as.data.frame(resSig),file="DESeq2_results.csv")

First, transform your data so you can visualize it more easily

    > nt <- varianceStabilizingTransformation(dds)

Then, make a beautiful heatmap

    > library(pheatmap)

If you get an error, first install

    > install.packages(“pheatmap”)

then load

    > library(pheatmap)

    > select <- order(rowMeans(counts(dds,normalized=TRUE)),decreasing=TRUE)[1:20]

    > log2.norm.counts <- assay(nt)[select,]

    > df <- as.data.frame(colData(dds)[,c("condition","sizeFactor")])

    > png(file="heatmap.png")

    > pheatmap(log2.norm.counts,cluster_rows=FALSE,show_rownames=FALSE,cluster_cols=FALSE,annotation_col=df)

    > dev.off()

Start adjusting the plot to see what happens

    > png(file="heatmap.png")

    > pheatmap(log2.norm.counts,cluster_rows=FALSE,show_rownames=FALSE,annotation_col=df)

    > dev.off()

    > png(file="heatmap1.png")

    > pheatmap(log2.norm.counts,show_rownames=FALSE,annotation_col=df)

    > dev.off()

    > png(file="heatmap2.png")

    > pheatmap(log2.norm.counts,show_rownames=TRUE,annotation_col=df)

    > dev.off()

Estimate which samples are more like one another

    > rld <- rlog(dds)

    > sampleDists <- dist(t(assay(rld)))

    > sampleDistMatrix <- as.matrix(sampleDists)

    > rownames(sampleDistMatrix) <- paste(rld$condition,rld$type, sep="-")

    > colnames(sampleDistMatrix) <- NULL

    > colors <- colorRampPalette( rev(brewer.pal(9, "Blues")) )(255)

    > png(file="heatmap3.png")

    > pheatmap(sampleDistMatrix,clustering_distance_rows=sampleDists,clustering_distance_cols=sampleDists,col=colors)

    > dev.off()

Make it in ggplot to alter it as you want

    > data <- plotPCA(rld,intgroup=c("condition","sizeFactor"),returnData=TRUE)
    
    > percentVar <- round(100*attr(data, "percentVar"))

    > png(file="ggplot_pca.png")

    > ggplot(data,aes(PC1,PC2,color=condition)) + geom_point(size=3) + xlab(paste0("PC1: ",percentVar[1],"% variance")) + ylab(paste0("PC2: ", percentVar[2],"% variance"))

    > dev.off()

The final frontier: Biological function

Now that you have a list of significantly differentially expressed genes we need to assign biological function to these genes. Take the top 20 differentially expressed genes and: 
Step 1) paste the list of gene names into the DAVID functional annotation tool (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/summary.jsp)
Step 2) Select Identifier (Flybase\_gene\_ID)
Step 3) List Type (Gene List)
Step 4) Submit List. Go to the bottom of the new page and hit “Functional Annotation Clustering.” You should see several clusters of biological function. These are calculated relative to the entire *D. melanogaster* gene complement and you will have both an enrichment score and a p-value. Spend some time exploring the biological functions that DAVID is assigning to your results.

Your homework: Compare the functional annotations between differentially expressed genes. Use David to examine the functional annotations for the top 20 differentially expressed genes in each comparison.

Your homework is to answer the following questions. 

1)	What patterns do you see? 
2)	Which types of biological function are enriched in these comparisons- i.e., what kinds of genes are up-regulated or down-regulated in your samples? 
3)	Why do you think these genes are being up- or down- regulated? 
4)	Do you think these results are biologically relevant? Why or why not? For example, look at the PCA of your treated and untreated samples. What does it tell you about your samples? 
5)	How do your results compare between the paraquat-treated and paraquat+LNAME-treated samples? For example, do you see the same genes up- or down-regulated in these samples? How does this inform your judgement of biological relevance?
