Alabama Supercomputer Orientation

We will be logging onto the ASC and doing some preliminary navigation. The first step is to get a username and password; please see me at the front. I need to keep track of the usernames and passwords in case any of you try to turn it into a spambot or decide to mine bitcoins or attempt other cyber crimes. 

We will begin to use our Bioinformatics Data Skills textbook this session. Refer to Chapter 4 for how to log on to the ASC. I have also included a short description below.

From the terminal we will use ssh or ‘secure shell’ to connect to the ASC. You can connect to either dmc or uv (it doesn’t actually matter which one you connect to). To connect type

    $ ssh -l *yourusernamehere* dmc.asc.edu

or 

    $ ssh -l *yourusernamehere* uv.asc.edu

The system will ask you for your password. Log on, change your password, and make sure you note your new password. We will use these accounts throughout the semester so DO NOT LOSE YOUR USERNAME AND PASSWORD. 

Once you are set up it’s time to learn a little about how to operate on the ASC. First, note that the terminal looks just like the terminal you use to interface with your local computer. This means that the Unix commands you have used can be used on the ASC but it also means that you can’t rely on old standbys like Microsoft Word or Excel. Type

    $ ls

and 

    $ pwd

to figure out where you are. We talked a little last time about how “.” is a location reference that indicates our current working directory. Similarly, “..” is a location reference that indicates one directory up. We can use this location reference to move out of our current directory and into an different directory. The command to change directory is ‘cd’ short for… change directory. Type

    $ cd ./

Now type 

    $ pwd

and 

    $ ls

What happens? You should be in the same place because you instructed the computer to cd to your current location. Now type

    $ cd ../

to go up one directory. Type

    $ pwd

and

    $ ls

Where are you now? What else is in this directory?

Go up another level

    $ cd ../

and type 

    $ ls

Where are you now? Try to look around a little bit (don’t worry, you can’t get anywhere you’re not supposed to be).

Sometimes it is helpful to know where things are located. ‘apps’ is where accessory files live, navigate into the directory

    $ cd apps

and then into the ‘bio’ directory, then into ‘unzipped.’ You will see a number of directories, these are commonly used databases. For example, these should be one called ‘blast’ that houses the blast databases. Navigate into ‘genomes.’ What do you find there? Navigate into one of the organism directories. What do you find inside? 

Inside that you should see a file called README. It will give information about the contents of that directory. Type

    $ more README

to see inside the file. Now navigate into one of the chromosome directories (probably starts with a CHR) and type

    $ ls

to see what’s inside. These are the index files for the genome you are looking at. They are formatted to make it easier to search each genome with blast, bowtie, and other alignment programs. Now navigate back to your home directory like this:

    $ cd ~

To see which programs are available type

    $ module avail

It will pop out a list of all the software available to use on the ASC. In order to use a program you type 

    $ module load ‘softwarenamehere’

For example, scroll through the list and find the blast modules. Try to load blast+/2.3.0. The ‘2.3.0’ indicates the version of the blast program that is available. Can you load ‘blast’? Can you load ‘blast+’ or do you need to type the whole name with the version number? To see the software in your path type

    $ module list

And to remove software from your path type (for example)

    $ module unload blast+

Now type 

    $ module list

again. What happens?

Now that we are on the ASC we can access regular Unix/Linux man pages. Complete the questions from the first tutorial (S_1) and email me the answers for in-class points.
